      <p><h1>MicroManager</h1></p>

      <p>This is a completed game that I made to participate in the GMTK game jam.​</p>

      <p>The theme of the jam was Role reversal. I had the idea to reverse the roles of the player and the computer, but in a user-friendly manner, where the player needs to deliver inputs to the processing unit as quick as they can.​</p>

      <p>I ended up having to cut out many ideas due to time constraints, not because of the constraints of the jam, but rather school, and being unable to access the project while there.​</p>

      <p>However, this is the most complete project that I have made to date. It is very simple and not massively interesting to play, however the main focus on my participation in the jam was to attempt to practice working against deadlines and simulating a real workplace where projects need to be completed to a high quality, and effectively within a time frame. ​</p>

      <p>I wrote all the scripts, designed the art, and wrote the music all myself, making this game truly original.​</p>

      <p>Now onto mechanics​</p>

      <p>I designed this game with ease of access in mind. I wanted to make sure that anyone of any age could access it easily.​</p>

      <p>Therefore, I opted to use the new input system in Unity. This allowed me to easily setup actions that the player could can bind buttons and axes to them from any device. ​</p>

      <p>As you can see in the video, there is a diegetic tutorial, showing the user what buttons to press. This being included in the world allowed me to simply show the user how to play the game without needing paragraphs of text explaining how to play, which would usually turn a potential player from the game. ​</p>

      <p>However, you can see that the tutorial changes depending on what input device the player is using. It switches between the keys and buttons on the gamepad that the user can use. This allows for an immersive experience, letting the player know how to play without interrupting the flow of gameplay.​</p>

    <div class="padding">
      <p>The next focus I had was to implement and slowly introduce new mechanics to the player, allowing them to get used to the gameplay over time without overwhelming them. This would ease the player into understanding the game without annoying them and, once again, turning them away. I still wanted to try and make the game as easy to play as possible, without being offensively easy. ​</p>

    <div class="padding">
      <p>This is the final level of the game. It introduces a new mechanic, where every instruction the player has learnt so far has to be used to complete the level. It includes a box that is able to press buttons where nothing else can. There are also two buttons that the player has to juggle with only one box, requiring them to once again learn how to use the box correctly. ​</p>

      <p>This mechanic isn’t necessarily obvious, but with the fact that both the buttons and the box are introduced at the same time, the hope is that they will realise that they need to use them in conjunction.​</p>

      <p>And of course, at the end of the game, a speedrun timer, to encourage replayability.​​</p>

      <p>I received very good feedback from people who played who were also participating in the jam.​ A common issue that I recognise was that the music was too loud, this would have been a very simple fix to solve, however.​</p>

      <p>Most said that they thought it was an interesting idea that they would like to see more of, which encourages me to return to this game at some point and expand on it some way.​</p>
