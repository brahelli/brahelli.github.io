      <p><h1>MicroManager</h1></p>

      <p>This is a completed game that I made to participate in the GMTK game jam.​</p>

      <p>The theme of the jam was Role reversal. I had the idea to reverse the roles of the player and the computer, but in a user-friendly manner, where the player needs to deliver inputs to the processing unit as quick as they can.​</p>

      <p>I ended up having to cut out many ideas due to time constraints, not because of the constraints of the jam, but rather school, and being unable to access the project while there.​</p>

      <p>However, this is the most complete project that I have made to date. It is very simple and not massively interesting to play, however the main focus on my participation in the jam was to attempt to practice working against deadlines and simulating a real workplace where projects need to be completed to a high quality, and effectively within a time frame. ​</p>

      <p>I wrote all the scripts, designed the art, and wrote the music all myself, making this game truly original.​</p>

      <p>Now onto mechanics​</p>

      <p>I designed this game with ease of access in mind. I wanted to make sure that anyone of any age could access it easily.​</p>

      <p>Therefore, I opted to use the new input system in Unity. This allowed me to easily setup actions that the player could can bind buttons and axes to them from any device. ​</p>

      <p>As you can see in the video, there is a diegetic tutorial, showing the user what buttons to press. This being included in the world allowed me to simply show the user how to play the game without needing paragraphs of text explaining how to play, which would usually turn a potential player from the game. ​</p>

      <p>However, you can see that the tutorial changes depending on what input device the player is using. It switches between the keys and buttons on the gamepad that the user can use. This allows for an immersive experience, letting the player know how to play without interrupting the flow of gameplay.​</p>
