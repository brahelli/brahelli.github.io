      <p><h1>Holo Pet</h1></p>

      <p>This is one of the more unique projects that I have been working on. It consists of a transparent box with a piece of transparent PVC card placed at a 45 degree angle in it. Then stuck to the lid is a tablet that runs an app that I have built. The display of the tablet is reflected by the card, and creates a hologram effect.</p>
      <p>The idea of the game is that it will be a virtual pet, where you need to look after it to keep it alive. It is very simple, and very much alike to Tamagotchis for example. However, the unique part of the this virtual pet is that it is a hologram that is internet enabled.</p>
      <p>Using another device, you can access the companion app that will allow you to feed and play with the pet from anywhere with an internet connection.</p>
      <p>Also, the PVC card in the video is damaged, as I used a piece that was too flimsy and could not support itself, and therefore bent very easily.</p>
