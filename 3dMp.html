      <p><h1>3D Multiplayer</h1></p>

      <p>This is my most ambitious project, despite being began 5 years ago. I tried to incorporate far too many things into this game when I began it, and therefore the workload was too immense for my capabilities at the time. ​​</p>

      <p>The idea of the game was that it was going to be a horror, multiplayer asymmetrical game, where multiple players complete objectives while one player attempts to stop that, like Dead by Daylight for example.​​</p>

      <p>Also, due to the age of this project, many packages and scripts are out of date for the version of Unity that I was using, and so you will most likely see many errors throughout me presenting this project to you.​</p>

    </div>

    <div class="padding">

      <p>One of the secondary focuses of this project was to try and implement higher fidelity graphics.</p>
      <p>This consisted of me using higher poly and resolution textures, alongside with post processing effects, in tow with the Universal Render Pipeline to create performant, yet good looking graphics</p>
      <p>One of the main effects that I used in this project was dynamic depth of field. This helped with the camera feeling more like a real eye, with it focussing purely on the areas that the player was looking at. This helps with immersion, and makes everything a little nicer to look at.</p>
      <p>While I used premade assets that I found on the asset store, I attempted to create my own environemnts the best I could, designing the hallways to be grim and dark.</p>

    <div class="padding">

      <p>The main objective of the game was for the player team to attempt to repair generators. Each geneerator, once activated, would allow the team to progress through the level. As you can see in the video, the first generator opened a door, which allowed the team to move on through the level.</p>
      <p>The enemy player would need to prevent them from accessing any generators, as it may hinder their abilities depending on what the generator did. At the end of the level, the team would be able to escape, but only after activating all generators. The enemy player would get stronger in order to give them a greater advantage in stopping the team from escaping.</p>
      <p>Each objective is synced across the network, creating a synonymous experience across all players. Doing this consisted of calling a class on each player machine once called, ensuring that everyone receives the same gameplay experience.</p>

    <div class="padding">

      <p>As you can see in the above videos, players are able to create a room with a name of their choosing. This acts almost like a password on its own, but of course an actual password system would need implementing. Once a room has been created, players can then join the room using the same code.</p>
      <p>Due to the project being quite old, there are many errors from out of date packages that appear here. I have not had time to fix these errors as of yet.</p>
      <p>Once in the room, players can see each other, with all animations and movement synced up properly across the network. Due to my skills not being great a few years back, the animations are very choppy and generally not pleasant to look at. However, everything does sync correctly and appear in the correct place across all clients connected to the room</p>

      <p>All in all, this project was far too complicated for me to even attempt back when I began it. However, now I feel that I would stand much more of a chance of being able to at the very least develop each independant mechanic to quite a high standard in comparison.</p>
