      <p><h1>3D Multiplayer</h1></p>

      <p>This is my most ambitious project, despite being began 5 years ago. I tried to incorporate far too many things into this game when I began it, and therefore the workload was too immense for my capabilities at the time. ​​</p>

      <p>The idea of the game was that it was going to be a multiplayer asymmetrical game, where multiple players complete objectives while one player attempts to stop that, like Dead by Daylight for example.​​</p>

      <p>Also, due to the age of this project, many packages and scripts are out of date for the version of Unity that I was using, and so you will most likely see many errors throughout me presenting this project to you.​</p>
